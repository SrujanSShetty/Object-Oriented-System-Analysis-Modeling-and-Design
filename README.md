# Object-Oriented System Analysis, Modeling, and Design Project

## Overview
This repository contains a series of assignments related to Object-Oriented System Analysis, Modeling, and Design, focused on leveraging GenAI technologies to enhance music composition and audience engagement. The assignments are structured in phases, each addressing different aspects of the project from problem analysis to data sourcing and ER diagram development.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Problem Statement and Solution Analysis
- **Background and Scenario**: Analyzed how an independent music composer, Daniel Schwartz, can leverage GenAI to enhance productivity and visibility across media channels.
- **Assignment Task**:
  - Proposed solutions using evolutionary AI technologies and data.
  - Discussed the value of these solutions and examined potential legal or ethical challenges.
  - Organized the write-up with a logical flow covering the problem statement, solution options, discussion/analysis, and conclusions.

### Phase 2: Product Canvas Development
- **Objective**: Developed a "Product Canvas" based on the solution options proposed in Phase 1.
- **Details**:
  - Created a PowerPoint presentation with two slides.
  - The Product Canvas includes key elements of the proposed product and addresses challenges faced during development.
  - Iterated on the canvas to refine the idea and ensure a comprehensive product definition.

### Phase 3: Data Sourcing Strategy
- **Objective**: Expanded on the Product Canvas to identify necessary data sources for the solution/application.
- **Details**:
  - Developed a data sourcing strategy to identify created vs. acquired data.
  - Presented the strategy in a PowerPoint or PDF format.
  - Addressed challenges encountered while developing the data sourcing strategy.

### Phase 4: ER Diagram Development
- **Objective**: Developed ER diagrams for the Artist Experience App, focusing on GenAI features in the composition process.
- **Details**:
  - Created ER diagrams representing entities and relationships.
  - Ensured normalization to the 3rd normal form.
  - Highlighted any modification anomalies and key pain areas during the design process.
  - Organized the ER diagrams into logical groups for clarity.

### Final Phase: Analytical Questions and Data Mapping
- **Objective**: Developed analytical questions to address the end state from the Product Canvas and mapped them to data sources.
- **Details**:
  - Created linkage tables between analytical questions and data sources.
  - Mapped questions against entities to validate the ability to answer them.
  - Prepared the results in a PowerPoint presentation or spreadsheet format, transforming them into a final PPT for submission.

Phase #1
Background and Scenario
-As an independent music composer, Daniel Schwartz wants to exploit “GenAI
capabilities” to increase his productivity in compositions. Given the context of
cognitive automation and GenAI that is emerging at a faster pace, Dan also wants
to identify/exploit better ways (rather than assuming conventional approaches) to
improve his visibility and reach with his current / future followership (fan base)
across media channels (digital and non-digital).
- Dan is unsure if genAI is hype vs reality, as he is not a technocrat. But, given media
attention to GenAI, Dan wants to embark on a new journey by partnering with you and
create magic by augmenting music creativity and technology
-How can Dan effectively or efficiently leverage GenAI and create value for his
firm and his audience?
Assignment #1
Task
-Please think about this problem statement and analyze, how can we use evolutionary AI
technologies and data to propose possible solutions
- Use your thinking hat and creativity
- As you propose solution option(s),
  -Please come up with some logical explanations on why you think there are no such solutions /
applications available
- If there are any existing solutions, then Dan could have purchased licenses
- Are there any legal or ethical challenges in your solution option(s) that need further exploration
  -Please organize your write up with a logical flow
- Problem Statement
- Solution options (How can we rethink about the problem statement through new tech lens)
- Discussion / Analysis (Why do you think it is valuable)
- Conclusions (your summary and reflections on this assignment)


**Phase #2 **
Develop "Product Canvas" based/extending on  Assignment#1
(You may need to go through few iterations by yourself. You may not get it right in your first attempt. Please don’t get disappointed. Keep trying and iterate for a few times. Submit your final version only)
Few Thoughts to explore to fine tune your idea.
What is the Product that you are going to come up with?
Follow any template that is available online to guide you
Ex: https://www.productplan.com/learn/business-model-canvas/
This is an independant assignment and group discussions wouldn't help in your skill building
Format –
Powerpoint with 2 slides –
Product Canvas
What are the key challenges that you faced in developing Product Canvas

**
Phase #3**
Guidance
Expand from Assignment #2 and identify what data sources are needed to build your solution/application
Identify which of the Data Sources are created vs acquired for your problem statement (ex. in next slide)
This takes more time. Please start on this activity as soon as possible and as you discuss with others about this, you may run into new possibilities of Data that you may need to bring together
Submission Format is Presentation (PPT/PDF)
Data Sourcing Strategy  - extension to your Assignment 2
Challenges faced while developing data sourcing strategy


**Phase #4 **
Problem Statement
Develop ER diagrams for Developing the Artist Experience App 
Assume Dan (or artist) is interacting with the app to exploit genAI features in their composition process
Use the conventions shared (ER Modeling) in class room for representing entities and relationships
Where applicable resolve into 3rd normal form
(Optional) highlight if you are addressing any modification anomalies with this design
Share Key Pain Areas during the journey
End Deliverable
PPT slides / PDF
Please break them into logical groups for readability
Reference Entities (or common entities that may touch multiple slides)
Detail them in first slide
Use, just the entity box (without any attributes in the subsequent slides for simplicity, as you have explained it in prior slides)
Process specific (or subject area specific)


**Final Phase **
Attached Files:
File Marketing Science - Analytics.xlsx (13.615 KB)
Develop analytical questions that lead to addressing end state from product canvas (assignment #2 review)
Develop the linkage tables between these questions and Data Sources
How can we potentially answer these questions? What data could be of help for further analysis?
Map these questions against Entities to validate if we will be able to answer the questions hypothetically or do we need to tap into other data sources
Due by Wednesday 11/01 before the start of class
Discuss example (Spreadsheet – Marketing Science in Pharma)
Submission Format – PPT
If it is easy to work out things in spreadsheet, please do so, and then transform it into PPT
